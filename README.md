# CarMaint-Backend

* Description:
    * This project is an application for keeping track of automobile maintenances the user has done to their car.  The application has complete CRUD functionality.  The user can create, read, update and delete a vehicle and maintenances on that vehicle.
    * I approached this project by thinking of something that I needed.  When performing maintenance on an automobile, it is useful to be able to record the details like date, mileage, price and invoice.
